# kanban_indexer

`kanban_indexer` is a simple Python library that implements a lexicographic indexing system for ordered collections, such as columns on a Kanban board. It uses a chracter-based system that should allow for an arbitrary number of insertions between any two existing indices without the need for reindexing.

## Features

- Generates string indices composed of characters A-Z
- Uses lexicographic ordering to determine item placement
- Creates new indices at the midpoint between existing indices
- Allows insertions before the first item and after the last item
- Avoids floating-point precision issues by using string comparisons
- Produces human-readable indices

## Installation

You can install `kanban_indexer` using pip:

`pip install kanban_indexer`

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use `kanban_indexer`:

```python
from kanban_indexer import compute_intermediate_index, compute_preceding_index, compute_succeeding_index

# Generate an index between "B" and "C"
middle_index = compute_intermediate_index("B", "C")
print(middle_index)  # Output: BM

# Generate an index before "A"
before_b = compute_preceding_index("B")
print(before_b)  # Output: AZ

# Generate an index after "Z"
after_z = compute_succeeding_index("Z")
print(after_z)  # Output: ZB
```

## API Reference

### `compute_intermediate_index(index_before: str, index_after: str) -> str`

Computes the intermediate index between two given indices.

### `compute_preceding_index(index: str) -> str`

Returns the preceding index value based on the given index.

### `compute_succeeding_index(index: str) -> str`

Returns the succeeding index based on the given index.
